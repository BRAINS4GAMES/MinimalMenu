Removes the clutter from the title screen. This small lightweight mod gets rid of the language, accessibility, and Minecraft Realm boxes. All are independently configurable. This mod also has compatibility with mod menu.

## Installation

1. Download and install Fabric from here: https://fabricmc.net/use
2. Download Fabric API mod from here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api and place in your mods folder.
3. Download minimal menu from [the github page](https://github.com/TomB-134/MinimalMenu/releases) and place in your mods folder.

#### TODO
* Ability configure features.
* Add mod menu support.
